This is testing project which is between me and abdul wali

By the way, this code is all about a distance adding and subtraction using OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING rules of C++.

Here we encapsulate distance variables which are feet and inch...
As we are adding feet and inches so we used such names for our variables...

As we all know that 12 inches and above then them will cause an increment in feet, so we designed functions in such manner that if user will enter more than 12 inches then those functions will increment them into feet...

**For more information please have a look on our code**
